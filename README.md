# <Horiseon Website>

## Description
The Horiseon website utilizes user-friendly features in order to allow users to navigate their website and display their services. The reason for this build was to help increase a coder-friendly experiance with comments and organized code. This allows for the website to have less code but work just as efficiently. Changes were made to the HTML and CSS file in order to keep everything organzied. Through this, I was able to learn that having less code with the right modifiers will provide a smoother coding experiance.
